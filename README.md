# ridtracker
Tracks record id in a Loan IQ database.
This project was originally a legacy c++ app now modernised in Java.
If you can't find what table the rid belongs or where else it exists, this app will find it.
For example, a Loan drawdown transaction may own a cashflow, consequently the rid will appear in both locations.
Example 2 - find all references to a customer within the DB.
